Ingredient Checklist

    ½ pound ground beef
    ½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
    1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
    ½ onion, chopped
    1 clove garlic, minced
    2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)

Directions
Instructions Checklist

    Step 1

    Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
    Step 2

    Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
    Step 3

    Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
    Step 4

    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
    Step 5

    Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.

Cook's Note:

You can use ground turkey in place of beef, if you like.
